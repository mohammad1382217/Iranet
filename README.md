**Redux Toolkit TypeScript**

This project shows how to integrate React.js with [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org).

The **Redux Toolkit** is a standardized way to write Redux logic (create actions and reducers, setup the store with some default middlewares like redux devtools extension). This project demonstrates each of these features with React.js (Vite Template)
